JP Morgan COIN Case Study: Automation of Legal Document Classification
Project Overview

This project outlines the comprehensive approach to automating the classification of legal documents for JP Morgan's COIN (Contract Intelligence) system, utilizing the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. The primary objective is to significantly reduce the time and errors associated with manual interpretation of commercial loan agreements by lawyers and loan officers, aiming to save over 360,000 hours annually.
Problem Statement

The core problem addressed is the manual and time-consuming process of classifying various legal documents, which is prone to human error. The goal is to develop and deploy an automated system that can accurately classify clauses within legal documents into predefined attributes, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy.
Methodology: CRISP-DM Framework

This project meticulously follows the six phases of the CRISP-DM methodology:

    Business Understanding: Defining the project's objectives (automating legal document classification) and assessing the current situation (manual, time-intensive, error-prone process).

    Data Understanding: Initial data collection (historical legal documents, expert annotations, scanned documents), data description (clause formats, patterns), exploration (meaningful patterns, variations), and quality verification (filtering irrelevant documents).

    Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming raw legal clauses into suitable data for modeling. This includes selecting relevant data, cleaning (OCR error correction, removing irrelevant elements, handling missing data), integrating various data sources, and formatting data (tokenization, label conversion).

    Modeling: Building and assessing machine learning models. This phase involved selecting appropriate techniques (traditional ML, NLP models like LSTM/CNN, transformer-based models like BERT/RoBERTa), designing tests (train-validation-test split, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), building models (preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning), and assessing performance to select the best model.

    Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluating the selected model's performance against business objectives. This includes assessing classification performance, reviewing the entire process for improvements, and determining next steps (deployment or further iteration).

    Deployment: Planning the integration of the COIN system into JP Morgan's workflow, including defining the deployment environment, developing user-friendly interfaces, establishing robust monitoring and maintenance protocols, and finalizing the project by transitioning ownership to operational teams.
